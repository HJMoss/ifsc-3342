        <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--  Hey Thomas!  -->
        <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
        <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
        <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

        <img class="image" src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg" alt="Responsive Design Meme">
        <h4>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute. </h4>
